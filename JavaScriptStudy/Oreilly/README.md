Linking CSS to html file is pretty much the same as the first part.

Here, we have `style.css` file to be linked to index.html.

<h2>Javascript Variables</h2>
</p>

From [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables):

> Note: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.

<div align="center">
<img width="800" height="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147919444-63e42d2b-f21c-4e74-ab4a-ba916851752a.png">

Variable declaration in Javascript is done as follows:

```js
let myName = "Burak";
let myAge = 26;
```

We can also declare variables without assigning to anything. This is called variable construction.

```js
let myName;
let myAge;
```

Printing the first one to the console

<img width="431" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-03 at 1 20 37 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147920001-e850fff9-6bb2-480e-b6cf-e2fc4c53134d.png">

printing second one

Meaning that variables created without assigning to anything has `undefined` value.

This is useful for if statements.

```js
let strings;
const willBeListOfStrings = true;

if (willBeListOfStrings) {
  strings = ["hello", "world"];
} else {
  strings = "hello";
}

console.log(strings);
```

Here, we can change the value of `strings` variable with respect to `willBeListOfStrings` variable.

<p id="var-hoisting">
<h2>var hoisting</h2>
</p>

<b>[var hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting) is an interesting topic. It is one of the topics that addresses the need for the existence of keywords like `let` in ES6.</b>

Before ES6, i.e., ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript only used `var` keyword for variable declaration.

For example:

```js
person = {
    name:"Burakhan",
    age:26
}

function logPerson(){
    console.log(person);
}

logPerson();

var person;
```

We expect that this code snippet should print `{name: 'Burakhan', age: 26}` to the console, and this is what happens. However, on the next line, we execute `var person;`, meaning that `person` should be assigned to `undefined`.

However, when we call `person` on the console, we have the following:

<img width="322" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-03 at 3 39 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147931511-8c599ee0-dd7b-46ac-b3a7-63de9f7d9ce8.png">

Why does this happen? In other words, why didn't executing `person` return an `undefined` value, but the assigned object literal instead?

This is because a phenomenon called `var hoisting`.

In the code above, there's more than meets the eye. Inherently, Javascript executes our code as follows:

```js
person = {
    name:"Burakhan",
    age:26
}
var person;

// ======== This is executed as below =======

var person;
person = {
    name:"Burakhan",
    age:26
}
```

This one of the reasons for introducing keyword `let` with ES6. If we try the same thing with `let`, we will get the following error:

<img width="447" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-03 at 3 44 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147931978-89df5022-a8a8-41a8-9d9f-e7186958ff5e.png">

So, by using `let`, we cannot assign a value to a variable before declaring.

This is very nice in in my opinion with two points :

1- This let's us declare variables on top of the scope, before doing anything else, which is very nice for the code structure.

2- It'd be much easier for fellow developers to understand the code.

<b>Hoisting no longer works with `let` keyword.</b>

<p id="cannot-redeclare-let">
  <h2>Not Being Able to Redeclare Variables with Let</h2>
  </p>

This is another important difference between `var` and `let`. When we use `let` keyword for variable declaration, we cannot redaclare the same variable twice, unlike `var`.

For example:

```js
function printSomething(){
    let myName = "Burak";
    console.log(myName);
    
    let myName = "Ahmet";
    console.log(myName);
}
```

This will raise error

However, using `var` doesn't print error on, as if it's normal to declare same variable twice.

<img width="558" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-03 at 5 50 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147944569-00b52111-7300-4121-a7d5-f90b7943d039.png">

The following is written on [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#a_note_about_var)

>Again, this is a sensible language decision. There is no reason to redeclare variables â€” it just makes things more confusing.
>For these reasons and more, we recommend that you use let in your code, rather than var. There is no reason to use var, unless you need to support Internet Explorer 10 or older with your code.

<p id="equality-vs-strict">
  <h2>Equality vs Strict Equality Operator</h2>
  </p>
  
 Both these operators are used for testing equality between two operands. However, the community seem to find `strict-equality` operator to be both faster and more reliable.
 
<b>Case 1: (False positives)</b>
 
 ```js
let myVar1 = 22;
let myVar2 = '22';

console.log(myVar1 == myVar2); // prints true
```

```js
let myVar1 = 22;
let myVar2 = '22';

console.log(myVar1 === myVar2); // prints false
```

Here, as we can see, even if `myVar1` and `myVar2` don't have the same types, i.e., integer and string, `==` returns true and `===` returns false.

Using `===` would be more logical here. Also faster. Faster because `==` does type conversion, where `===` doesn't make this and directly compares.

<b>Case 2: (Performance)</b>

<img width="562" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-03 at 6 41 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31994778/147950275-43a326a8-4bd7-4ee3-ac1b-94cd23d9bc76.png">

Looking at the above image, we see that `===` is superior to `==` in that the former spends less time doing the evaluation.
